# nba-player-hot-zones

Python program that utilizes pandas dataframes & matplotlib graphics to take info on NBA players’ shot attempts and compare their stats with league average stats from various areas of the court.
The comparison is done in a visual manner that illustrates how well the player is shooting from a certain area of the court.
Red represents above-average areas(AKA areas where they may be 'hot' from), whereas blue represents below-average areas.
The transparency of each section represent just how far ahead/behind they are in regards to the rest of the league.
